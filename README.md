Coding portfolio

# Description

This portfolio was created with the intention of displaying my coding projects in a convenient format for employers. 

Using basic HTML and CSS, this was my first project. Over a two week period, I learned about styling, typography, and positioning to make this website aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, I practiced using a variety of semantic tags, classes, ids, and comments to organize my HTML in a way that makes sense to myself and (hopefully) to other users.

This portfolio contains three HTML files and two CSS files. It explains who I am as an aspiring coder, displays a gallery of my projects, and allows viewers to contact me directly.

In the future, I would like to add media queries, flex boxes, and javascipt to enhance the users' experience.
